#Hool React;

 In React, the state is data or properties you can use in our application. States are mutable, meaning their
 value can change, and for that, the useState() hook is used to handle and manage your states. The useState()
  hook takes in the initial value of the state variable as an argument. This value could be of any data type, 
  such as string, number, object, array, and lots more.

  It is essential to know that the useState() hook does not return just a variable, as seen above, but it also
   returns a second value, a function that you can use to update the state value.
